# Roulette-based CAPTCHA concept
The roulette-based CAPTCHA concept is a series of CAPTCHAs that can be done using a wheel as its base point of control that the users can move to identify if they are humans or automated machines. The design in this repository is created and can be accessed using Balsamiq Wireframes application.

## Introduction
This is created using the Balsamiq Wireframes app that is mostly used for low-fidelity prototyping and UX design.

## Questions
1.  How good is it, in practice, as a CAPTCHA? Can we think of an easy way to build a bot that passes it? Will every human pass it?

    - Currently, no AI is specialized to solve this kind of CAPTCHA. In order to create one that can pass it, we need to create a bot that not just reads the roulette itself to get all the answer, but also gets the context of the question stated and the way to adjust the control of the roulette CAPTCHA.
    

2.  How user friendly is the CAPTCHA? Humans, unlike machines, have short attention spans, so labelling a hundred different picture might be, in theory, a good CAPTCHA, but humans wonâ€™t sit through that!

    - Humans can easily distinguish the answer since many are familiar in controlling color wheels. If they are not sure about the way to solve, a pop-up can be added to help them solve the problem.
    
  
3. How creative is it? There are many standard CAPTCHA mechanics, can you either:
	 a.) Combine them in a unique and fun way? b.) Create a brand new method?
     
     - This is similar to some other CAPTCHAs that observes time it the user takes to answer the questions. I believe this is a good way to identify humans from automated systems.
    

4.  How applicable is it to different situations? AI is beginning to invade many different areas of life. Traditionally CAPTCHAs are used on websites, but would your CAPTCHA be able to be used in different circumstance. For example, to tell the difference between a lifelike robot and a real person in a real-life setting? How about over the phone? Argue why your CAPTCHA is the CAPTCHA of the future.

    - This is applicable to most text- or image-based applications. Identifying bots from humans in the context of voice is a different field than what we are trying to solve right now. Since most of our content online are text-based, this will still be useful in the near future to identify humans from automated systems.
    
    As this is also a series of roulette-based CAPTCHAs, there are a lot of potential to further improve it in the future, like adding image as the base for the CAPTCHA test and adding other complexities that can be added to the actual wheel-spinning process. The concept is not just limited to what is shown in this design.
